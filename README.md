# NeuralNetwork-Diabetic-Retinopathy
This uses the dataset for Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set then using neural networks from scratch to learn from the data then comparing it with libraries and another type of prediction being tree classification

Run the program through and there are hypermeter for both sections which are labelled above the code block that in the hyperparameters for the manual MLP.

For the second section with using the libraries, the hyperparameters can be seen within the function itself.
